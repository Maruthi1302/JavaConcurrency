/**
 * Semaphores: A semaphore is a counter that controls the access to one or
 * more shared resources. This mechanism is one of the basic tools of concurrent
 * programming and is provided by most of the programming languages.
 * 
 * CountDownLatch: The CountDownLatch class is a mechanism provided by the Java
 * language that allows a thread to wait for the finalization of multiple operations.
 * 
 * CyclicBarrier: The CyclicBarrier class is another mechanism provided by the
 * Java language that allows the synchronization of multiple threads in a common point.
 * 
 * Phaser: The Phaser class is another mechanism provided by the Java language that
 * controls the execution of concurrent tasks divided in phases. All the threads must
 * finish one phase before they can continue with the next one. This is a new feature of
 * the Java 7 API.
 * 
 * Exchanger: The Exchanger class is another mechanism provided by the Java
 * language that provides a point of data interchange between two threads.
